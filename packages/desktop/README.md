# OpenCode Desktop

The OpenCode Desktop app, built with Electron.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Build

Run the `build` script to build the app's JS assets, then `package` to
bundle the assets as an application. The resulting app will be in `dist/`.

```bash
bun run build && bun run package
```

Production builds require a prebuilt V2 CLI distribution. The release workflow supplies the artifact from the same run:

```bash
OPENCODE_CHANNEL=prod OPENCODE_CLI_DIST=/absolute/path/to/packages/cli/dist bun run build
OPENCODE_CHANNEL=prod bun run package
```

Set `OPENCODE_CLI_TARGET` when packaging for a different architecture. The CLI is placed outside `app.asar` in the
application's resources directory, and packaging fails if it is missing.
